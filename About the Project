In this tutorial, you will learn how to train a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras on the Fashion MNIST dataset, enabling you to classify fashion images and categories.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is meant to be a (slightly more challenging) drop-in replacement for the (less challenging) MNIST dataset.

Similar to the MNIST digit dataset, the Fashion MNIST dataset includes:

60,000 training examples
10,000 testing examples
10 classes
28×28 grayscale/single channel images

The ten fashion class labels include:
1.T-shirt/top
2.Trouser/pants
3.Pullover shirt
4.Dress
5.Coat
6.Sandal
7.Shirt
8.Sneaker
9.Bag
